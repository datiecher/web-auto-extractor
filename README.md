## This is a fork of [`raine/web-auto-extractor`](https://github.com/raine/web-auto-extractor) where I've fixed some small bugs and upgraded the dependencies to run on modern versions of Node and NPM.

For the complete documentation, refer to [`raine/web-auto-extractor`](https://github.com/raine/web-auto-extractor), since the features and API on this fork are exactly the same as that version.
